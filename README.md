# GettingAndCleaningData
Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

There are 3 files in this repository:
* run_analysis.R - the R script that gets and cleans data creating the file tidy.txt.
* Codebook.md - this file describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean the original data.
* tidy.txt - the txt file containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional information
Prior to running the R script, do not forget to check the directory on you computer/laptop.
